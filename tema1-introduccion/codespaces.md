# GitHub CodeSpaces

## Introduction 

GitHub Codespaces allows users to use a Visual Studio Code backed editor, terminal, and debugger along with GitHub version control in the browser or on a desktop. 

Integrating Codespaces into your GitHub Classroom experience can provide a scalable solution for quickly getting CS students started using virtually any device including Chromebooks and iPads. 
If it’s got a browser, it’s now a development environment for your students.

Here is the documentation: [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces):
